# FACM Architecture

## Product boundary

The maintained product is FACM 3.5.x lightweight: **WinForms + .NET Framework 4.8 + one FACM.exe**. The repository intentionally avoids restoring the retired 4.x WinUI/Core/Infrastructure/Platform/bootstrapper architecture.

## Solution

`FACM.sln` contains four current projects:

- `src/FACM` — main WinForms application.
- `src/FACM.ToolBundle` — validated embedded tool resources.
- `src/FACM.Updater` — small Windows updater used for atomic EXE replacement and rollback.
- `src/FACM.PetHost` — optional .NET 8/WPF VPet runtime source, validated separately.

The normal 3.5 build embeds ToolBundle but does **not** embed a self-contained PetHost ZIP.

## Main host

`Program.cs` creates one `FacmHost` and registers small modules around the existing 3.5 services. `ShellModule` owns the primary `MainForm`; the compact menu, tray and floating entry remain WinForms surfaces.

The module layer is an ownership/lifecycle boundary, not a separate 4.x application architecture. Do not split the product into a new Core/Infrastructure/Platform stack without a concrete 3.5 requirement.

## League runtime

League features share one client/session boundary and one Gameflow monitor.

Important rules:

- Features consume the shared Gameflow state; do not create competing phase polling loops.
- Connected phase reads are authoritative. Process presence is only a fallback when LCU is temporarily unavailable.
- Cadence is activity-based: disconnected/reacquisition 3s, Queue/ReadyCheck 3s, ChampSelect about 2s, InGame 10s, ordinary client state about 5s.
- Lobby/ReadyCheck automation evaluates immediately when the relevant phase is observed.
- Stable Lobby membership uses a fingerprint to prevent duplicate search writes.
- Failed/ambiguous matchmaking writes reconcile `/lol-matchmaking/v1/search` before deciding to retry.
- ReadyCheck attempts use an episode fence; true failures can retry after a short delay, while a final local response prevents duplicate writes.

## Mayhem / ChampSelect

Mayhem keeps the established 3.5 service/cache/network path. UI code must treat win-rate values as **0..100 percentage points** and must not multiply by 100 again.

Do not replace the current fast service with a 4.x data stack merely for architectural consistency. UI completeness, cancellation, bounded waits, cache behavior and fail-soft handling are the relevant contracts.

## Desktop entry and pets

`DesktopEntryGameflowPolicy` owns in-game suppression semantics:

- first InGame transition suppresses desktop entry surfaces;
- restore ownership is recorded only when Gameflow hid something that had been visible;
- repeated InGame observations do not repeatedly close a control center explicitly reopened by the user;
- leaving InGame restores only Gameflow-owned visibility.

`PetsModule`/`AnimalPetManager` expose active and visible state. `VPetHostClient` tracks requested visibility so hide/show intent survives host startup races.

## Update architecture

`OnlineService` reads version/announcement/mirror metadata. `UpdateInstaller` downloads the approved 3.5 Release EXE, verifies it and extracts the embedded `FACM.Updater.exe`. The updater waits for FACM to exit, atomically replaces the EXE, validates the result, restarts it and can roll back on early failure.

There is no current 4.x migration/bootstrapper mode. Unknown legacy JSON properties are ignored rather than used as runtime migration instructions.

## Build contracts

CI must enforce:

- ToolBundle input integrity and embedded resource presence.
- optional PetHost build/self-test.
- no `FACM.Resources.PetHost.zip` in ordinary FACM.exe.
- FACM.exe <10 MiB.
- host, League dashboard/automation, performance, updater, floating-ball, pet and Mayhem smoke tests.
- UI text contract.

## State ownership rules

Prefer one owner per mutable runtime concern:

- one Gameflow monitor;
- one shell/MainForm;
- one updater replacement path;
- one desired pet visibility state;
- one online version manifest;
- one canonical 3.5 lightweight publisher.

When asynchronous work can finish after context changes, use cancellation/generation/fingerprint/postcondition checks rather than adding arbitrary sleeps.
